# What of dinner - lab 1 - variant 3 - Set based on binary-tree

This is an example project which demonstrates project structure and necessary
CI checks. It is not the best structure for real-world projects, but good
enough for educational purposes.

## Project structure

- `BinaryTree.py` -- implementation of `BinaryTree` class and `BinaryTreeNode` class.

- `BinaryTree_test.py` -- unit and PBT tests for `BinaryTree`.

## Features

- PBT: `test_add_commutative`
